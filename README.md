# K-nearest neighbor smoothing for high-throughput single-cell RNA-Seq data

This repository contains reference Python, R, and Matlab implementations of the k-nearest neighbor smoothing algorithm ([Wagner et al., 2017](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/11/21/217737)) for UMI-filtered single-cell RNA-Seq data.
